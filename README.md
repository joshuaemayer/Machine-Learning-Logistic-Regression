# Machine Learning - Logistic Regression

# Background

In this project we'll use a dataset of heights and weights of males and females to hone our understanding of classifiers. We load the data into a dataframe and plot it.

# Resources

This data set is available in the sklearn python module which is how we will access it today.

# Conclusion

Basic concepts learned include: scatterplot creation (matplotlib and seaborn),  basic use and interpretation of sklearn - logistic regression and cross-validation. I learned to create my own test/train methodologies as well as leverage the GridSearchCV tool to automate the process.
